# Testing PHP on Web Server #


To test that your system is properly configured for PHP, let's create a very basic PHP script called info.php. In order for Apache to find this text and present it correctly, it must be saved in your web root directory.

Create the file in the web root created in the previous step with the command ;


sudo nano /var/www/fatihkelesoglu.com/public_html/bilgi.php


An empty file will open. Add the following code inside the file, which will print the valid PHP information ;


<?php
phpinfo();
?>


Save and close the file when you're done.

You can now test whether your web server is correctly displaying the content generated by this PHP script. Visit this page in your web browser to try it out. You will need your server's public IP address or domain name again.
