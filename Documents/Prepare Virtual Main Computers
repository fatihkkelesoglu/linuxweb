# Prepare Virtual Main Computers #


When using the Apache web server, you can use hosts (similar to server blocks in Nginx) to encapsulate their dense details multiple times and host them on a single server in a virtual server.

I've created as fatihkelesoglu domain name.You can follow the screenshots about the part and then you can create and check own domain name.



sudo mkdir -p /var/www/fatihkelesoglu.com/public_html

sudo chown -R www-data: /var/www/fatihkelesoglu.com

sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/fatihkelesoglu.com

nano /var/www/fatihkelesoglu.com/public_html/index.html

sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/fatihkelesoglu.com.conf

sudo a2ensite fatihkelesoglu.com

sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/fatihkelesoglu.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/

sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf

sudo apache2ctl configtest


If you see "Syntax OK" output,everything has been completed.just restart apache2 and then you can try.

sudo systemctl restart apache2


You can go to website line and you can check your domain name.


Important Notice : If you see a error message like "apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1. Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message"

You need to make basic step.I've added some screenshots about the problem.If you open img11 and img12 screenshots,you will see solution about the problem.
