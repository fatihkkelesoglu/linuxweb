Look at the Apache Full profile with the command below, you should see that ufw is providing traffic to ports 80 and 443 :


sudo ufw app info "Apache Full"


Profile: Apache Full

Description: Apache v2 is the next generation of the omnipresent Apache web
server.

Ports:

If you see your ports : 80,433/tcp , you can continue the process.


If you don't see your ports numbers like 80,433 or you see some
different ports.You can go to the codes and you can check or create new one.


sudo ufw allow in "Apache Full"


Finally,everything has been completed.You need to learn your pc's ip address and then you can put your ip address on the search line.If you success for all process,you must see "Apache 2 Ubuntu Default Page "
